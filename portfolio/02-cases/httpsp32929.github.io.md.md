# Assessment 1
## Summary

- 1/25/2023
- httpsp32929.github.io
- A software engineer portfolio, displaying skills, projects, and contact info.

## Strength
The layout of the website is very reminiscent of the visual studio installer. That is pretty cool. The layout is very simple and easy to navigate. Itâ€™s also got some fun fidget tools like swapping the background color. I like small things like that.

## Improvements
- It is a bit cramped. It would be nice if we could have larger text or more spread out indexes. The margins for text are also cramped, especially in the about me.
- I would ask this person what their strongest skills are, since most of the skills are listed in alphabetical order.

## Best fit
I would probably hire this person to do some dev ops and/or web development. His list of languages include php, sql, python, and bash/powershell, which is great for that type of development. He also has related dev op tools down such as kubernetes. His projects also largely support web app development. I would hire him for CI/CD for web apps. Have him make tools to help automate certain tasks that can be cumbersome when done by an individual. Interactions would include needing to know what needs to be automated and working closely with a few teams to implement the needed tools and automation features.

## General considerations
The contact page is fine. I do think the "Buy Me a Coffee" and Instagram page is strange to list. It isn't a way I would contact you to do business.

# Assessment 2
The other student willing to do multiple assessment for the same portfolio, just create an entry in the index following the same structure and same the assessment differently in this case, we put number 2. And use the same structure on the 1.
